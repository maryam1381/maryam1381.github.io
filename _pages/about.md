<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>
  Hi, I am <b>Maryam Jafari Sarvolya</b>. I recently graduated with a <b>B.Sc. in Computer Engineering</b> from the <a href="http://www.iust.ac.ir/">Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST)</a> in October 2025.
</p>

These days, I spend much of my time with my family, which I value deeply.

Outside of my academic path, I enjoy swimming, spending time with my friends, and taking care of plants—activities that make me feel alive and help me stay grounded in the real world. I love traveling and try not to limit myself to familiar or repetitive experiences, as I believe personal growth comes from exploring new paths and perspectives.

I am also an avid reader, especially of novels, although I have been a bit distant from reading lately. My favorite book is "The Girl Who Saved the King of Sweden".
