<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>
  Hi, I am <b>Maryam Jafari Sarvolya</b>. I recently graduated with a <b>B.Sc. in Computer Engineering</b> from the <a href="http://www.iust.ac.ir/">Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST)</a> in October 2025.
</p>

<p>
  While I am passionate about <b>Machine Learning</b> and building intelligent systems, I believe there is more to life than just code. I am a curious learner who enjoys exploring the intersection of technology and society. 
</p>

<p>
  When I am not working on optimization algorithms, you can usually find me <b>gardening</b>, capturing moments through <b>photography</b>, or exploring new ideas in FinTech. I love finding simple solutions to complex problems—whether in a dataset or in a garden.
</p>

  🚀 <b>Next Steps:</b> I am currently preparing applications for <b>M.Sc. programs (Fall 2026)</b>. I am actively seeking a research environment where I can contribute to work on Federated Learning and large-scale networked systems.
