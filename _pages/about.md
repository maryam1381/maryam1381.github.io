I recently completed my **B.Sc. in Computer Engineering** at the **Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST)**.
My academic interests lie at the intersection of **Machine Learning**, **Federated Learning**, and
**Optimization for large-scale networked systems**.

My bachelor's thesis, *Robust Learning-to-Optimize for D2D Caching*, focused on risk-aware optimization
using **CVaR** under uncertainty, combining neural networks with stochastic modeling.

I am currently preparing applications for **MSc programs (Fall 2026)** and actively seeking
research-oriented environments where learning, optimization, and distributed systems intersect.
